# 💳 Explainable Credit Risk Assessment

## 📘 Overview
This project presents an **explainable machine learning framework for credit risk assessment**, integrating data preprocessing, model training, and explainability using SHAP and LIME.  
The system enhances transparency in financial decision-making by providing an interactive Streamlit app where users can visualize model predictions, interpret feature importance, and perform “what-if” analyses.
